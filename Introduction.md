# Introduction to Serena

Serena is a shiny dashboard application for the visualization of biological data.
These data come from a company database which is composed by 3 type of users:
- Employees
- Specialized practitioners
- Technical administrators

Every user is provided, from the company's Microsoft Access interface, with a personal file.
These files contain records of employees' biological data in two different contexts:

- Home records: biological data recorded while the employee is at home during his every-day life
- Work records: biological data recorded while the employee is undergoing a medical visit at the company's clinic

For the TA, the file contain a list of every other user' information, to give him the possibility to have a general view of the company's user's differentiation.

The aim of Serena is to provide a user-friendly interface to visualize different type of data giving the users the possibility to control different settings of visualization.
